### Basketball with Sofia:
Baskets | Reward
:---: | ---
0  | +1 Effort, +1 Romance
1  | +1 Effort, +1 Romance
2  | +2 Effort, +1 Romance
3  | +3 Effort, +1 Romance

<br>

Tips and info:
- If you are using a mouse and keyboard to play the game there are two ways to stop the arrow: pressing space or clicking the mouse. Clicking a mouse is much faster than pressing space.
- You can click anywhere on the screen to stop the arrow. If you find the minigame to be difficult though, positioning your cursor at the center of the middle bar can improve eye-hand coordination when clicking.
- The game has no time limit so wait for the arrow to go back and forth a few times to understand the correct timing.
- If you are using my patch and talk to Sofia she will ask if you want to cheat. If you say yes you automatically get 3/3 baskets and skip the minigame.
- If you aren't using my patch or don't want to cheat but want to make sure that you always get 3/3 baskets, you can easily savewhore by saving your game at locker #13 before starting the minigame. If you don't get 3/3 baskets then reload that save and walk back to Sofia and try again until you do.

### Selling sex toys for Scarlett:
Map | Map | Map
:---: | :---: | :---:
1 | 2 | 1
3 | 2 | 1
2 | 0 | 0

<br>

This is a map that shows the number of people that spawn in each part of town. There are 12 people that spawn and they always start in the same place. Keep in mind that the people randomly move around after they spawn, so this just gives you a general idea of where people are.

<br>

Tips and info:
- The amount of money you get is the # of items you sold multiplied by 2. So if you sell 12 you get $24. If you sell 9-12 items then you also get +1 Romance with Scarlett.
- This minigame is easy albeit somewhat frustrating at the same time since your character's pathing can screw up and clicking on people isn't very responsive. But you'll usually be able to sell to all 12 people with 7-10 seconds to spare.
- A good strategy is to start by going northwest first then make your way around town counterclockwise so you don't waste time walking somewhere you've already been.

### Effort Combat Bonus
Effort | Damage | Bullet Damage | Bullet Range | Bullet Size
--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 | 8-10 | 5-9 | 4 | 1
2 | 8-11 | 5-10 | 4 | 1
3-4 | 8-12 | 5-11 | 4 | 1
5-6 | 8-13 | 5-12 | 4 | 1
7-8 | 8-14 | 5-13 | 4 | 1
9-10 | 9-15 | 6-14 | 5 | 2
11-20 | 10-16 | 7-15 | 5 | 3
21-30 | 11-17 | 8-16 | 5 | 3
31-40 | 12-18 | 9-17 | 5 | 3
41+ | 13-19 | 10-18 | 6 | 4

<br>

Currently, having effort higher than 41 is not useful. You can get the maximum bonus at 41 and increasing effort past that doesn't give anymore bonuses.
