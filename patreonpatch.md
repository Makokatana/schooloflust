**Notes:**  
- You **need** to back up your game folder because the patch overwrites files
- Your uncle might incorrectly call Flora 'Mom'

**Requirements:**  
- v0.20e **only**
- Game MUST be enigma unpacked (decrypted). Using it on v0.20e when it's still encrypted won't work.

### **Installation:**  
- **Back up your original game folder**
- Extract the folder in the zip file to the game folder you wish to patch
- Run Incest_Patch.bat from the www folder that's in your game directory

<br>
<br>

### **Converting Saves**:  
If you want to use your old saves with the incest patch they need to be converted first. If for some reason you no longer want to play with the incest patch, you can convert your saves back so they'll work with the unpatched game. In the instructions below if I say 'game folder', that means your patched game folder.

- In your game folder go to ```/www/saves``` (preferably delete all file# saves except the one you wish to convert)
- Click on the editor download link and download and extract the save editor
- Open ```index.html``` inside the editor folder to bring up the tab and with it open your most recent save file
- Select all the text and copy it into ```/www/saves/save.txt``` and save it
- Open ```Save Converter``` and select an option
- Open ```save.txt``` and select all the text and copy it
- Delete all the text in the RPGM Save Editor html tab, paste the new text, and click 'save' to download your converted save
- Put the converted save in your save folder
- (For the previous step if you converted your save back to normal also copy (only copy, no need to convert) ```config.rpgsave``` and ```global.rpgsave``` from your patched game save folder back to your unpatched game save folder as well)
