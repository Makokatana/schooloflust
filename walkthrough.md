**A quick note about the walkthrough:**  
This is a 100% walkthrough - that means if you follow the guide you'll get 100% of the scenes and content in the game. So I'll be doing all the quests and sidequests as well. Skipping the intro will prevent you from getting the day 1 Flora romance point, so even if you are replaying the game you shouldn't skip the intro.

**A quick note about the walkthrough:**  
There's been two updates since I started this so I have to look through those and change some things for the full walkthrough on this page. I wouldn't follow this page exactly because I'm going to change things this weekend so it's best to wait till then if you want to start a new game and follow this guide exactly. I'll remove this note when I've updated it. You can still use this page as a reference though and the other pages in this walkthrough are accurate, just not fully complete since I've only written up to the first week of the game.
