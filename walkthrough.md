**A quick note about the walkthrough:**  
This is a 100% walkthrough - that means if you follow the guide you'll get 100% of the scenes and content in the game. So I'll be doing all the quests and sidequests as well. Skipping the intro will prevent you from getting the day 1 romance point with your mom, so even if you are replaying the game you shouldn't skip the intro. Also if there is a choice or event that isn't mentioned in the walkthrough that means you can choose any option.
